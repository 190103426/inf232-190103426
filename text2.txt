I have got some hobbies. I’m always very busy but when I’m free I like to read books. I think books help me to continue my education. In my opinion, books are a source of new and useful information. I enjoy reading books about life of famous people, but I hate reading detectives. I think it’s just a waste of time. I also love music. My favorite types of music are dance music, hip-hop and rock. I like to draw.  I’m also a photographer. I like to take photos.
Sometimes I play different sport games. My favorite games are basketball, tennis and volleyball. I don’t like to watch TV, but I do it from time to time. I often go for a walk or to the cinema with my friends
